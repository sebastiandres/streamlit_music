[song]
[C]I know your [Em]eyes in the morning [Dm]sun,
[A]I feel you [Dm]touch me in the [E]pouring [G]rain.
[C]And the [Em]moment that you [Am]wander far from me,
[Dm]I wanna feel you [G]in my arms again.
[F]And you come to [Em]me on a summer breeze,
[F]Keep me warm in your [Dm]love, then you softly leave.
[Em]And it's me you [F]need to show: [G]How deep is your love?.
[C]How deep is your love? How deep is your love,
[Am]I really mean to [Dm]learn.
[C]'cause we're [Em]living in a world of [A]fools breaking us down,
[Dm]when they all should [F]let us be, we be[C]long to you and me.
[Em]I believe in [Dm]you, you know the [A]door to my [Dm]very [E]soul. [G]
[C]You're the [Em]light in my [Am]deepest, darkest night,
[Dm]you're my saviour [G]when I fall.
[F]And you may not [Em]think I care for you,
[F]when you know down [Dm]inside that I really do.
[Em]And it's me you [F]need to show : [G]How deep is your love.
[C]How deep is your love? How deep is your love,
[Am]I really mean to [Dm]learn.
[C]'cause we're [Em]living in a world of [A]fools breaking us down,
[Dm]when they all should [F]let us be, we be[C]long to you and me.
