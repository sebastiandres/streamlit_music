[C] I don't care if [F] Monday's blue
[C] Tuesday's grey and [G] Wednesday too
[Am] Thursday I don't [F] care about you
It's [C] Friday I'm in [G] love
[C] Monday you can [F] fall apart
[C] Tuesday Wednesday [G] break my heart
[Am] Thursday doesn't [F] even start
It's [C] Friday I'm in [G] love
[F] Saturday [G] wait
And [Am] Sunday always [F] comes too late
But [C] Friday never [G] hesitate
[C] I don't care if [F] Monday's black
[C] Tuesday Wednesday [G] heart attack
[Am] Thursday never [F] looking back
It's [C] Friday I'm in [G] love
[C] Monday you can [F] hold your head
[C] Tuesday Wednesday [G] stay in bed
Or [Am] Thursday watch the [F] walls instead
It's [C] Friday I'm in [G] love
[F] Saturday [G] wait
And [Am] Sunday always [F] comes too late
But [C] Friday never [G] hesitate
[Am] Dressed up to the [F] eyes
It's a wonderful [C] surprise
To see your [G] shoes and your spirits [Am] rise
Throwing out your [F] frown
And just smiling at the [C] sound
And as sleek as a [G] shriek
Spinning round and [Am] round
Always take a big [F] bite
It's such a gorgeous [C] sight
To see you [G] eat in the middle of the [Am] night
You can never get [F] enough
Enough of this [C] stuff
It's Friday [G] I'm in love
[C] I don't care if [F] Monday's blue
[C] Tuesday's grey and [G] Wednesday too
[Am] Thursday I don't [F] care about you
It's [C] Friday I'm in [G] love
[C] Monday you can [F] fall apart
[C] Tuesday Wednesday [G] break my heart
[Am] Thursday doesn't [F] even start
It's [C] Friday I'm in [G] love
