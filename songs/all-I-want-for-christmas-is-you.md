[song]
[G] I don't want a lot for Christmas
[G] There's just one thing I need
[C] I don't care about the presents
[Cm] Underneath the Christmas tree
[G] I just want you [B7]for my own
[Em] More than you could [Cm] ever know
[G] Make my wish come [E7] true
[Am7] All I want for [Am7] Christmas is 
[G]you[Em]ou
[C]ou[D]ou
[G] I don't want a lot for Christmas
[G] There's just one thing I need
[C] I don't care about the presents
[Cm] Underneath the Christmas tree
[G] I don't need to hang my stocking
[G] There upon the fireplace
[C] Santa Claus won't make me happy
[Cm] With a toy on Christmas day
[G] I just want you [B7]for my own
[Em] More than you could [Cm]ever know
[G] Make my wish come [E7]true
[Am7] All I want for [Am7]Christmas is 
[G]you[Em]ou
[C]ou[D] baby
[G] I won't ask for much this Christmas
[G] I don't even wish for snow
[C] I'm just gonna keep on waiting
[Cm] Underneath the mistletoe
[G] I won't make a list and send it
[G] To the North Pole for Saint Nick
[C] I won't even stay awake to
[Cm] Hear those magic reindeers click
[G] 'Cause I just want you [B7]here to night
[Em] Holding on to [Cm]me so tight
[G] What more can I [E7]do
[Am7] Baby all I want for [Am7]Christmas is 
[G]you[Em]ou
[C]ou[D] baby
[B7] All the lights are shining
[Em] So brightly everywhere
[B7] And the sound of children's
[Em] Laughter fills the air
[Cm] And everyone is [G]singing
[G] I hear those [E7]sleigh bells ringing
[Am7] Santa won't you bring me the [Am7/D]one I really need
Won't you [C] please bring my baby to [C] me
[G] Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
[G] This is all I'm asking for
[C] I just want to see my baby
[Cm] Standing right outside my door
[G] Oh I just want you [B7]for my own
[Em] More than you could [Cm]ever know
[G] Make my wish come [E7]true
[Am7] Baby all I want for [Am7]Christmas is 
[G]you[Em]ou
[C]ou[D]ou
[G] All I want [Em]all I really want 
is [C] you  [D] baby
[G] All I want [Em]all I really want 
is [C] you  [D] baby
