[song]
[C] Somewhere [Em] over the rainbow
[F] Way up [C] high
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dreamed of
[G] Once in a lullaby [Am] --- [F]
[C] Somewhere [Em] over the rainbow
[F] Blue birds [C] fly
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dreamed of
[G] Dreams really do come [Am] true [F]
[C] Someday I'll wish upon a star
[Em] Wake up where the [Am] clouds are far [F] behind me
[C] Where trouble melts like lemon drops
[Em] High above the chimney [Am] tops is where you'll [F] find me
[C] Somewhere [Em] over the rainbow
[F] Bluebirds [C] fly
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dare to
[G] Oh why, oh why [Am] can't [F] I?
[C] Someday I'll wish upon a star
[Em] Wake up where the [Am] clouds are far [F] behind me
[C] Where trouble melts like lemon drops
[Em] High above the chimney [Am] tops is where you'll [F] find me
[C] Somewhere [Em] over the rainbow
[F] Way up [C] high
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dare to,
[G] oh why, oh why [Am] can't [F] I?
