[song]
[Am] [Dm] 
[G] [Cmaj7]
[Fmaj7] [Bm7b5] 
[E7sus] [E7]
[Am] First I was afraid, I was [Dm] petrified kept thinkin' 
[G] I could never live  without you [Cmaj7] by my side but then   
[Fmaj7]I spent so many nights thinking [Bm7b5]how you've did me wrong And I grew 
[E7sus4] strong, I learned [E7]how to get along...
[Am] And so you're back from [Dm] outer space, I just walked 
[G] in to find you here with [Cmaj7] that look upon your face, 
[Fmaj7] I should have changed that stupid lock, I [Bm7b5] should have made you leave your 
[E7sus] key- If I'd have known for just one second you'd[E7] be back to bother me.
[Am] Oh now go, walk out the [Dm] door, Just turn around 
[G] now, you're not welcome [Cmaj7] anymore. Weren't you the 
[Fmaj7] one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think
[Bm7b5] I'd crumble? Did you think I'd  
[E7sus] lay down and [E7] die?
[Am] Oh not I, I will sur[Dm]vive, Yeah, as long as 
[G] I know how to love, I know I'll be [Cmaj7] alive. I've got all my 
[Fmaj7] life to live, I've got all my love to give, I will [Bm7b5] survive, I will sur
[E7sus]vive, Yeah, [E7] yeah...
[Am] It took all the strength I [Dm] had just not to fall 
a[G]part, I'm tryin' hard to [Cmaj7] mend the pieces of my 
[Fmaj7] broken heart, And I spent oh so many nights just [Bm7b5] feelin' sorry for 
my[E7sus]self, I used to cry, But [E7] now I hold my head up high.
[Am] And you'll see me with some[Dm]body new, I'm not that 
[G] stupid little person still [Cmaj7] in love with you. And 
[Fmaj7] so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to [Bm7b5] be free, But now I'm 
[E7sus] saving all my lovin' for [E7] someone who's lovin' me,
[Am] Oh now go, walk out the [Dm] door, Just turn around 
[G] now, you're not welcome [Cmaj7] anymore. Weren't you the 
[Fmaj7] one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think [Bm7b5] I'd crumble? Did you think I'd 
[E7sus] lay down and [E7] die?
[Am] Oh not I, I will sur[Dm]vive, Yeah, as long as 
[G] I know how to love, I know I'll be [Cmaj7] alive. I've got all my 
[Fmaj7] life to live, I've got all my love to give, I will  [Bm7b5] survive, I will 
sur[E7sus]vive, Yeah, [E7] yeah...
